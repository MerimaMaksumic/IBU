//Create a program that counts how many seconds there are in a year. You can assume that a year consists of 365 days (therefore the year is not a leap year). The program should print the following:

package Lab1;

public class exercise3{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int numberOfSeconds=60*62*24*365;
        System.out.println("There are "+numberOfSeconds+" in the year.");
    }
}
